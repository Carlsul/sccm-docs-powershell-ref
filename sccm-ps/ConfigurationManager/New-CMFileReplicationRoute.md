# New-CMFileReplicationRoute

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a file replication route for Configuration Manager.

## SYNTAX

```
New-CMFileReplicationRoute -DestinationSiteCode <String> [-DestinationSiteServerName <String>]
 [-FileReplicationAccountName <String>] -SourceSiteCode <String> [-DisableWildcardHandling]
 [-ForceWildcardHandling] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **New-CMFileReplicationRoute** cmdlet creates a file replication route for Configuration Manager.
Configuration Manager uses file replication routes to transfer file-based data between sites in a hierarchy.
Each file replication route identifies a destination site to which file-based data can transfer.

File replication routes were known as addresses in versions of Configuration Manager before Configuration Manager.
The functionality of file replication routes is the same as that of addresses in earlier versions.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration Manager cmdlets must be run from the Configuration Manager site drive.
> The examples in this article use the site name **XYZ**. For more information, see the
> [getting started](/powershell/sccm/overview) documentation.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a file replication route
```
PS XYZ:\> New-CMFileReplicationRoute -DestinationSiteCode "IM5" -SourceSiteCode "IM1" -DestinationSiteServerName "ImgDataServer01" -FileReplicationAccountName "AdminRepl01"
```

This command creates a file replication route from the site that has the site code IM1 to the site that has the site code IM5 on the server named ImgDataServer01.
Configuration Manager uses the account named AdminRepl01 to manage data transfer over this route.
