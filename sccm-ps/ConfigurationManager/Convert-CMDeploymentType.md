# Convert-CMDeploymentType

## SYNOPSIS

Converts the deployment type of a Configuration Manager deployment application.

## SYNTAX

```
Convert-CMDeploymentType -InputObject <PSObject> [-DisableWildcardHandling] [-ForceWildcardHandling]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The **Convert-CMDeploymentType** cmdlet converts the deployment type of a Configuration Manager application.

A deployment type is contained within an application and contains the information that Configuration Manager requires to install software.
A deployment type also contains rules that specify if and how the software is deployed.

This cmdlet allows for getting a native DeploymentType object from an SMS_DeploymentType WMI object instance. Can be combined with [Get-CMDeploymentType](Get-CMDeploymentType.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration Manager cmdlets must be run from the Configuration Manager site drive.
> The examples in this article use the site name **XYZ**. For more information, see the
> [getting started](/powershell/sccm/overview) documentation.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
PS XYZ:\> $cmdp = Get-CMDeploymentType -ApplicationName "CenterApp"
PS XYZ:\> Convert-CMDeploymentType $cmdp
```

This command gets the deployment type for the application named CenterApp, and then convert the deployment type.
